# Project Inception - 42 School

Inception is a challenging project from the 42 School curriculum that delves into the realm of virtualization and system administration. The project aims to deepen the understanding of how virtual machines work by setting up a small infrastructure using Docker containers.

In this project, students are tasked with creating a virtual machine using Docker. The virtual machine will run multiple Docker containers, each serving a specific purpose:

1. A WordPress website.
2. An NGINX webserver.
3. A MariaDB database linked to the WordPress website.

The project requires setting up a Docker network for the containers to communicate with each other efficiently and securely.

## Learning Objectives

Through the Inception project, students gain hands-on experience and knowledge in the following areas:

- Virtualization concepts and techniques
- Docker containerization and container management
- NGINX web server configuration
- WordPress installation and setup
- MariaDB database administration
- Docker networking and container communication

By completing this project, students develop a solid foundation in system administration, containerization, and infrastructure management. They learn how to create and configure virtual environments, deploy web applications, and manage databases using industry-standard tools and practices.

The Inception project is an essential step in the 42 School curriculum, preparing students for more advanced projects and real-world challenges in the field of system administration and DevOps.
